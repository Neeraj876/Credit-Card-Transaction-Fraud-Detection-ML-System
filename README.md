# Credit Card Transaction Fraud Detection ML System

An MLOps pipeline that transforms credit card transaction data into real-time fraud detection predictions. Built on modern open-source technologies including Kafka, Spark, Ray, and MLflow, this project demonstrates a complete ML lifecycle from data ingestion through model deployment. The system features automated CDC, real-time feature serving, and comprehensive observability.

## üìä Dataset

> Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection Dataset

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data). This dataset contains a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions.

The data spans 24 months (January 2019 to December 2020) and covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

### Modeling: Credit Card Transaction Fraud Prediction

The core modeling task is to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent at the moment it is processed.

You can download the dataset and put it under the `dataset` folder.
